My name is Thomas Nedelec. I am a Research Scientist at the Paris Brain Institute, in the ARAMIS Lab. I am a member of the Center for AI and Data Science for neurological disorders.  I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of Paris-Saclay, where I had the privilege of being advised by Prof. Noureddine El Karoui and Prof. Vianney Perchet. Before my PhD, I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from École Polytechnique.

I am interested in applying new statistical models and data science techniques to improve our understanding of major health challenges. My research currently focuses on comparing the epidemiology of neurological disorders and on better understanding the early signs of these diseases—also known as the prodromal phase.

To conduct this research, I use large real-world health databases and have developed a robust framework that enables consistent analyses across international consortia. My work is currently funded by a grant from the EU Joint Programme – Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND).

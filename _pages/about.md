My name is Thomas Nedelec. I am a Research Scientist at the Paris Brain Institute. I got my PhD in Applied Mathematics at the University of Paris Saclay, where I was fortunately advised by Pr. Noureddine El Karoui and Pr. Vianney Perchet. Before my PhD, I got my B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science at Ecole polytechnique. I am interested in applying new statistical models and data science techniques to try to improve our understanding of some important health and economics problems. My research is currently funded by a EU Joint Programme – Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND) grant.

My name is Thomas Nedelec. I am a Research Scientist at the Paris Brain Institute. I got my PhD in Applied Mathematics at the University of Paris Saclay, where I was fortunately advised by Noureddine El Karoui and Vianney Perchet. I got my B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science at Ecole polytechnique. My current goal is to apply new statistical models to various health problems.

My name is Thomas Nedelec. I am a Research Scientist at the Paris Brain Institute. I got my PhD in Applied Mathematics at the University of Paris Saclay, where I was fortunately advised by Pr. Noureddine El Karoui and Pr. Vianney Perchet. Before my PhD, I got my B.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science at Ecole polytechnique. My current goal is to apply new statistical models to try to solve various health and economics problems. My research is currently funded by a EU Joint Programme â€“ Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND) grant.
